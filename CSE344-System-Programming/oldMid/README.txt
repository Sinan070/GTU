ps: Hocam, all the downloaded files are stored in download directory.
    All the uploaded files are stored in server_files directory.

    You can download files from server_files and upload any files you want into the server_files directory.
    Also I could not connect to server with server id. All the clients will connect to the only 1 server. Sorry.
